# Client side application examples

This repo aggregates several examples of client side web development. I wrapped them in an unnecessary express application just so I could practice throwing together a Hello World equivalent express app, and served up this readme as a home page.

    - Repurposed form submission
1. [Grocery List](./grocery-list/groceries.html)
