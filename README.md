# Client side application examples

This repo aggregates several examples of client side web development. I wrapped them in an express application pretty unnecessarily, just so I could practice throwing together a Hello World equivalent express app.

## Examples

1. [Simple calculator](./calculator/simple-calculator.html)
2. [Grocery List](./grocery-list/groceries.html)
3. [Company Site](./company/home.html)
